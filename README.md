For many newcomers to machine learning — whether you’re a student, researcher, or a software engineer curious about AI — learning and practicing ML can feel a bit cookie-cutter. That was certainly my experience when I first started out.
Working with toy datasets on Kaggle was fun in the beginning, and it’s a fantastic way to learn the fundamentals. But after a while, I found myself wondering: does this really prepare someone for the messy realities of building and deploying these models in the wild? Real-world projects rarely come with perfectly labeled data, clear problem definitions, or step-by-step example solutions.
What I felt was missing were practical, end-to-end examples — projects that begin with a messy dataset and end up with a working application. The kind of projects where you stumble through trial and error, hit unexpected roadblocks, and gradually piece together a working model. That’s where you start to uncover the hidden challenges of AI, and more importantly, where you start to really learn.
In this article, I share my experience from my first real-world end-to-end ML project, outlining the roadmap I followed, the thought processes behind it, and the key lessons I learned along the way. The goal was simple: find a suitable dataset and use it to build an eye-tracking application from scratch. Eye tracking is increasingly becoming an important branch in machine vision. It’s used in a wide range of applications, from fatigue detection in driver monitoring to virtual reality.
